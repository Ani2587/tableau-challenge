Overview:

Since 2013, the CitiBike program has been collecting and organizing data on a monthly basis, making it publicly available on the CitiBike website. In this analysis, I am focusing on CitiBike usage during the summer, exploring various factors. The hypothesis under consideration is whether bike usage increases as summer reaches its peak. The analysis utilizes the most recent data available for the summer of 2023, with four datasets corresponding to June, July, and August. To derive meaningful insights, I have developed four dashboards.
I will be focusing on the following analysis areas:
•	Growth of riders during the summer
•	Identification of the most popular start and end stations
•	Determination of peak hours during the summer
•	Comparison between Member and Casual riders"

Summary: 
The overall analysis indicates that the most popular areas for riders during the summer of 2023 (June-August) are in New Jersey, particularly in Hoboken and Hudson County. Peak hours are from 7:30 am to 8:30 am and 4 pm to 8 pm, with classic bikes being more popular than electric bikes during the summer. Additionally, it is observed that more members use bikes than casual riders. However, members tend to use bikes for shorter durations and distances compared to casual riders during the summer.
